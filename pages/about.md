My name is Morten Brøns-Pedersen, but most people just call me Brøns (stylized
as `br0ns` in text).  I currently live in Copenhagen where I'm working on my
Ph.D. at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.diku.dk) at University
of Copenhagen.

I'll write some more about myself Soon^TM^, but until then you can check me out
on [GitHub](https://github.com/br0ns).
